Qadars is one of the lesser known banking trojans, but just as dangerous as its more famous counterparts, such as Dridex, URSnif, Ramnit, Neverquest, Shifu, and others. The first version of this trojan\u00a0appeared in 2013\u00a0when it mainly targeted countries such as the Netherlands, France, and Italy. Qadars v2 came out in 2015, and by that time, the trojan was busy targeting banks and users in Australia, Canada, the US and the Netherlands.

AlienVault polled 222 security professionals at Black Hat 2016 to learn how their security teams have changed over the last two years, how the security landscape has evolved over the past 12 months, and how they are incorporating threat intelligence into their malware defence strategies.\u00a0 Investment in Security Teams Rise as Threats Escalate The majority of respondents (62%) stated that, over the last two years, their security teams have increased in size. While this is not overly surprising, as more and more research is showing increased investment in security, it is an encouraging sign considering the security skills shortage that has plagued the industry for years. Shedding light on one of the driving forces behind the increase in security teams, more than half of survey participants (53%) reported an increase in security incidents over the past year. Threat Intelligence: A Moral Obligation\u00a0 An overwhelming majority of respondents (76%) believe that the security industry has a moral responsibility to share threat intelligence. Although there is no requirement or mandate for companies to do so, many security professionals feel that if they observe an active exploit, it is their duty to share it with others. This view is a key reason why threat intelligence \u2013 which helps organisations enhance threat detection and incident response \u2013 is rapidly being recognised as a critical aspect of security for both organisations and vendors. And organisations are backing up this belief with action. An overwhelming 95% of survey respondents use threat intelligence in some way.\u00a0 Range of Threat Intelligence Sources Still Increasing Survey respondents rely on a range of threat intelligence sources, including their own detection processes (66%), trusted peers (48%), paid subscription services (44%), government agencies (38%), crowdsourced/Open Source communities (37%) and blogs/online forums (28%). These survey results are in line with years past. AlienVault asked this same question at Black Hat 2015 and RSA 2014. The results of each survey show that, year-over-year, the range of threat intelligence sources that companies rely on has consistently increased. One of the reasons for this wide range is that threat intelligence can be additive in nature. A company can rely primarily on its own internal detection processes, but can complement this method with sources such as a government feed, or by pulling data from a crowdsourced platform, with little overlap in the data obtained. By referencing more threat intelligence sources, a company can gain a more comprehensive view of the overall threat landscape. Rise of Crowdsourced Platforms for Threat Intelligence Sharing Security professionals stated that they share threat intelligence with trusted peers (56%), internally (47%), with government agencies (28%), publicly (18%) and with crowdsourced/Open Source platforms (15%). Compared to responses from Black Hat 2015 and InfoSec 2015, where this same question was asked, there has been a gradual increase in the number of respondents sharing threat data publicly, as well as with trusted peers. The largest jump has been in the adoption of crowdsourced platforms for threat intelligence sharing, which increased by almost five times since last year. This trend will continue to escalate as confidence in threat sharing platforms increases and as the trusted peer groups of security professionals expands. \u201cThe nature of the security industry has been extremely secretive, so it\u2019s very encouraging to see that more people are utilizing different sources and are willing to more openly share threat intelligence,\u201d said Javvad Malik, security advocate at AlienVault. \u201cMalicious criminals innovate quickly, and the more our industry can achieve a similar level of agility through cooperation and collaboration, the more we can create a powerful collective defense against today\u2019s advanced threats. Public threat intelligence sources, such as AlienVault\u2019s Open Threat Exchange, enable even the smallest IT departments to leverage the collective knowledge of a global network of security experts to better identify, respond to and mitigate threats. We hope to see continued trust in these sources.\u201d Additional Resources", "published": "2016-09-22T09:17:58+00:00", "resource_type": "web", "resource_label": "itsecurityguru"}, {"title": "500m Yahoo accounts were hacked in 2014, company confirms", "link": "http://www.itsecurityguru.org/2016/09/23/500m-yahoo-accounts-were-hacked-in-2014-company-confirms/", "content": "In one of the biggest data breaches of all time, Yahoo has said 500 million user accounts may have been hacked.

This is according to Phil Bindley, CTO of The Bunker, who warns that organisations are fighting a losing battle if they fail to get company culture right. Data streams throughout organisations and is often used by everyone in some way. This means that without a cultural appreciation of how data should be treated, the risk to GDPR compliance remains high. The GDPR is designed to better protect citizens\u2019 data and harmonise legislation across Europe. The regulation brings a number of new guidelines for organisations in relation to Personally Identifiable Information (PII). In order to ensure a best practice approach to securing data is achieved, business leaders need to create a culture of information security by embedding sound processes within their organisations. Phil Bindley, CTO of The Bunker, explains: \u201cWith the GDPR coming into force a culture of information security has a major part to play in ensuring firms are able to demonstrate and maintain compliance. Although technology is an important factor, what it fundamentally comes down to is people and processes. It\u2019s not about building a bigger firewall, it\u2019s about changing the way organisations and their employees behave and treat the data that they hold on behalf of their customers.\u00a0 \u201cInformation security professionals have a huge part to play in creating this culture. They need to speak the language of the board so they can explain the commercial benefits of behaving in a secure way. Businesses need to instil sound practices and ensure all staff look through a lens of data security. It\u2019s vital to have a complete picture of everything that has the possibility to impact security. Everyone within a business needs to think about what they do on a day-to-day basis to make sure they behave in a way that is beneficial to the company as a whole, this extends all the way to the boardroom. Only then can organisations achieve a best practice approach to IT security. \u201cThe GDPR provides a framework that encourages organisation to evaluate whether or not they are behaving in a secure way. It\u2019s a real opportunity to change the way that information security is approached and it should be welcomed by businesses. By embracing a culture of information security, organisations will be more competitive, can manage risk, protect their brand, and innovate in a controlled way. This in turn will allow organisations to compete at a European level; in order to trade with other European nations, organisations need to be compliant with the GDPR standard as and when it comes into existence. If business fail to embrace the changes they won\u2019t be able be able to understand the associated risks. Businesses need to understand risks in order to make decisions about where to invest and grow.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s a competitive advantage of working with a cloud service provider (CSP) that values security, especially when an organisation\u2019s customers reside in sectors that constantly evaluate this, such as financial services and government. With the introduction of the Data Protection Officer, supply chains are going to be tested to make sure data is being handled in the correct way. Fundamentally, without a secure framework in place, people are going to be less likely to want to do business with you,\u201d concludes Bindley.", "published": "2016-09-21T09:06:36+00:00", "resource_type": "web", "resource_label": "itsecurityguru"}, {"title": "The Ethical and Legal Dilemmas of Threat Researchers", "link": "https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/cisotociso/the-ethical-and-legal-dilemmas-of-threat-researchers", "content": "SHARE. ray pompon Threat intelligence is mainstreaming into a de-facto everyday tool of cyber-defense.
